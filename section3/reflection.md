## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- 'There's always room to grow' has always resonated with me and is exactly why I'm here. Throughout anything in life, there's always something new to learn and if you're learning you're growing. 'Understanding mistakes are essential to learning' can't be a truer statement. Sometimes you have to figure out what doesn't work before you figure out what does.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- I demonstrate a growth mindset by being willing and wanting to learn, asking for help when I absolutely need it, and using trial and error learn from. I'm not so good at setting goals and seeking out challenges.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
- Amazon most likely uses arrays to store a list of past orders.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
- A piece of code that performs an action on an array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
- The purpose of a loop is to repeat an action multiple times using one command. A loop used in conjunction with an array could be used to add items to a grocery list or songs to a playlist. Each item in the array needs the same action performed. Making copies would be an example of when you would use a loop without an array. The same action is performed over and over, but not for different items.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
- It's like counting repetitions while exercising. Each repetition is a loop.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
- What happens if you unintentionally create a loop that doesn't terminate?
