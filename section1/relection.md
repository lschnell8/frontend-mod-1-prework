## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
- Unfortunately, the SuperLearner Article was not accessible.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
- string - data type that consists of letters and other characters wrapped in single or double quotes.
- number - data type that consists of positive, negative, or decimal number values.
- boolean - data type that has a true/false value.  

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
- console.log("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
- // would indicate code comment in JavaScript. Code comment helps others read and understand your code and can also serve as a reminder for yourself.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
- A variable is a value that can change and is stored for later use.
I would tell a 5 year old that it's a box that can hold a toy, but you can change which toy is in the box.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
- itemsInCart (array), userName (string), numberOfItemsInCart (integer)

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
- Combining string values.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
- A concatention would be used in a greeting to combine the generally greeting with a userName.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
- In what instances would it be better to use concatenation vs interpolation?
