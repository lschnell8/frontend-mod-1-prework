## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
- I've never liked asking questions and still don't feel great about it, but I ask when I absolutely need to. I do usually wait too long to ask though.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
- It was tough at times and uncomfortable because of the time it took and all the trial and error. Ultimately though, it made me look harder for small mistakes and think more about why what I did or didn't do was wrong.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
- conditionals are criteria used to control conditional instructions. A daily life conditional would be making a plan to go on a hike, but having a backup plan to stay in and do a puzzle if it rains. Amazon probably uses a conditional to calculate taxes on a order based on zip code.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
- Add multiple conditions to an `if` statement by using `else if` and `else`. `If` evaluates if condition true and executes a code if it is. `Else if` evaluates if a condition is true or false and runs one set of code for true and another set of code for false. `Else` executes another block of code if the `if` condition is false.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
- Logical operators

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
- I can't think of a specific question right now, but I definitely still need some practice with these.
