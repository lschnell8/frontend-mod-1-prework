## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
- Workflow didn't feel much different than what I normally do.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
- I found that sometimes giving my eyes a break helped me find errors more effectively, but ultimately my time estimations were totally off.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
- An object is a collection of paired data. An object is similar to an array, but arrays don't pair data together and they can hold elements of different data types.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class - Array because it's a collection of elements.
  * List of states and their capitals - Object because it pairs states with their capitals.
  * List of things to pack for vacation - Array because there are not data to pair.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow - Array because it's only a list of names.
  * List of student names and their cohort - Object because student names are paired with their cohort.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake - Object because ingredients and amounts are paired data.
  * All my favorite restaurants - Array because it's a list with no paired data.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
- Door Dash. Keys might be a menu item paired with a dollar value or meal paired with contents (i.e. comes with fries and drink).   

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
-  Where do you draw the line for an Object or a class?
